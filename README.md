# ADS507Project
Data Science for Social Scientist Final Project 

This Codes part includes all works for this project. 

**requirement.txt includes required packages for this project.

CSV files which are including different states name creating by using Google API and they include location of Esso Stations in locationfinding.py
They were creating using locationfinding.py. I used it for every different state and create a different csv files which can be found. 

After that with using web scrapping I found the distribution of esso gas stations with using WebScrapping.R in website: https://de.fuelo.net/gasstations?lang=en
With state_data I created the DistributionEssoBtwStates.csv file to colored map. 

Then with using map.generator I created the colored map to show distribution and markered the locations of Esso stations which are found by using GoogleAPI in locationfinding.py

**Google API allows to see only 60 different locations. Because of that I can show maximum 60 different Gas Stations for different states.
